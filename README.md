Overview
Ecozon revolutionizes e-commerce by embedding sustainability at its core. It transforms shopping experiences through eco-friendly product offerings, transparent rating systems, and waste-reduction initiatives like a packaging return program. Aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Ecozon promotes responsible consumption, enhances environmental consciousness, and fosters a culture of sustainability.

Problem Statement
Environmental Impact of Waste:
India generates 62 million tons of recyclable waste annually, but only 25% is recycled. The remaining waste pollutes landfills and the environment.

Lack of Recycling Systems:
While mechanisms exist for recycling returned packaging, there are no dedicated systems for collecting and recycling outer packaging of used products.

Consumer Demand vs. Adoption:

81% of consumers want companies to be eco-friendly.
Only 36% buy sustainable products due to unclear information and limited accessibility.
High-Cost Solutions:
Existing solutions, like Amazon Aware, are niche and expensive, limiting their scalability for broader adoption.
